  <p> With India having the <b> second highest number </b> of recorded coronavirus cases, it is reassuring to know that technology is swooping in to save the day. Meet <a href="https://mitrarobot.com/"> Mitra: </a> a robot that helps hospitals by taking on manual tasks and allowing for patients to <b> communicate remotely </b> with their loved ones at home. </p>
<p> Project Mitra had a rocky start. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/invento-makerspaces"> Invento Robotics</a>, the company behind this robot, is based in <b>Bangalore </b> and was founded by <b> Balaji Viswanathan and his wife Mahalakshmi Radhkrishnan</b>. With their combined expertise in manufacturing and human-robot interaction, they had a vision to create robots which could <b>improve patient well-being in hospitals </b>. However, their initial vision never took traction, so the couple instead designed robots which assisted banks, where they identified visitors, printed passes, and took customer feedback. Nevertheless, their robots made their way into the hospital once the <b> coronavirus hit</b> and the necessity of such an invention was realized. </p>
<p> Mitra means <b> friend </b> in Hindi, and that is exactly what the robot is to both the patients and the doctors in a hospital. When coronavirus patients need to stay in the hospital for a long time and cannot access their phones, Mitra helps them stay contacted with their family. The robot has <b> a video screen and a camera </b>attached to its chest, and can remember the names of the people it interacts with through <b> facial recognition technology</b>. It can also disinfect surfaces, answer questions from patients, and roam around the hospital, enabling video call if necessary. </p>

<p> “It may sound ironic, but we are <b> using robots to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/tech/robots-india-covid-spc-intl/index.html"> bring humanity </a> to the hospitals </b>,” says Viswanathan. The robots are already deployed in the <b> <a href="https://www.yatharthhospitals.com/"> Yatharth Hospital </a> of Noida, </b> a city in northern India. There, the Mitra robots are either at the entrance, screening patients for coronavirus symptoms, or in the intensive care unit attending to patients. The robot is the nurse’s assistant as well, taking vitals or reminding patients to take their medicine. </p>
<p> Furthermore, Mitra helps connect patients with their family and lets the family take a <b> deeper </b> look inside to the patient’s surroundings, since they cannot be present with the patient. “Patients get happy and positive whenever the robot visits them. They are often clicking selfies with Mitra,” says hospital director Kapil Tyagi. However, if the patient ever wants a private conversation with their family, a booth can be built around Mitra to ensure privacy. While Mitra costs $10,000 right now and is only used in India, it is fascinating to see how <b> technology is advancing humanity in such a time of crisis</b>.

              <figcaption class = "btext"> How hard is it to maintain direct eye contact with the person you are speaking to? Eventually it gets uncomfortable and you either try to glance somewhere else for a bit, then go back to their face, then look at the bug on the floor, then their left eye, then their right eye….ugh how much longer until this convo ends? Luckily, Disney’s new robot in the making understands your social awkwardness and instead maintains a realistic and interactive robot gaze. Disney Research, researchers at Imagineering, as well as researchers from the University of Illinois and the California Institute of Technology

            <figcaption class = "bby">By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
            <figcaption class = "btext" >  Unprecedented times call for unique answers to unprecedented problems. While TeenHacks LI can’t support an in-person 24 hour hackathon due to COVID-19, we are adapting to a new format: a triathlon, but for hackers! Have you ever participated in a triathlon? It involves three types  of races: swimming, cycling, and running. Our tri-hackathon is divided into three exciting parts as well: Learn-a-thon, Build-a-thon, and Share-a-thon! Though we can’t host hackers in person, we now have an opportunity to expand our work to three separate events—combining the best parts of a hackathon!
