Since then I have been diving into many different subjects relating to computer science, mainly programming, cyber security, and recently graphic design. In addition to this I started the first computer science clubs at my high school, recently participated as a mentor for Code Labs (summer program of Code Day), and am actively involved in Girls Who Code and Girls Go Cyberstart. As a part of the marketing team I want to help as many people as possible find out about this hackathon so people (especially like me who don't have many opportunities like this in my area) can come and experience what hackathons are like and be introduced to a whole new community with similar interests. In my free time I enjoy taking/editing pictures, spending time with my family, and traveling.</p>
