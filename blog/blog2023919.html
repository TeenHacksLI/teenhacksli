    <div class="column middle text" style="">
      <p>&ldquo;<strong>Concrete city</strong>&rdquo; is a phrase attributed to many communities around the United States that share high-tech infrastructure, bustling workdays, and eccentric nightlife. However, as society progressed and cellular network towers emerged, critics began to view these structures as <strong>disruptions to the city's aesthetic harmony</strong>. On the Pacific coast, this challenge was met with a unique perspective &ndash; an endeavor to blend nature with technology, resulting in the creation of "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/00000179-a9d8-d2eb-ad7f-edfbab010000-123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fauxliage</a>," a playful moniker for the innovative tree-like communication beacons.</p>
      <p>Mobile cellular communication has undergone <strong>rapid evolution</strong> since the 1980s. The shift from tethered phones to portable devices was pioneered by <strong>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone</strong> in 1979 in Tokyo. These early brick-like phones symbolized the transition from <strong>0G </strong>(wired analog devices) <strong>towards 1G</strong> (the first generation of mobile networks). Notably, <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1191361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motorola's DynaTAC</a>, the first 1G phone accessible in the US, carried a staggering price tag of nearly <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-much-would-the-great-gadgets-of-the-past-cost-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4,000 in 1984</a>.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>But how do cell phones connect us?</strong> In simplified terms, they emit electromagnetic radio waves that network towers convert to and from light pulses. Given your phone's SIM card or your laptop's IP address, data can <strong>traverse the globe</strong> via this expansive international network of towers.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Despite representing a significant leap in telecommunications, the first generation unveiled critical vulnerabilities that hindered seamless network utilization. These include:&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Subpar sound quality</li>
      <li>Restricted roaming capabilities</li>
      <li>Limited expressive modes (primarily audio)</li>
      <li>And a deficiency in encryption and security features</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The second generation of mobile networks (2G) was designed to address the latency issues inherited from 1G. A significant innovation during this era was the <strong>introduction of multimedia capabilities</strong>, specifically the ability to transmit and receive videos. Devices of the second generation, such as the <a href="https://nokia.fandom.com/wiki/Nokia_3210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nokia 3210</a>, supported <strong>SMS </strong>(short message service) and <strong>MMS </strong>(multimedia messaging). These features operated by <strong>encapsulating data into</strong> "<strong>packets</strong>," which were then transmitted in fragments for later reassembly.</p>
      <p>Shortly following the launch of 2G, cellular network towers (similar to the one depicted above) began emerging along the Pacific coast. In 1992, Larson Co., now a <a href="https://investors.valmont.com/news/news-details/2019/Valmont-Acquires-Industry-Leading-Provider-of-Wireless-Concealment-Solutions/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsidiary of Valmont Industries</a>, released their first disguised towers designed to <strong>resemble native trees</strong> of the region. Notably, Larson Co. had previously specialized in crafting <strong>landscapes for the entertainment sector</strong>, contributing to iconic installations in venues like Disney, Las Vegas, and the Arizona Science Center. However, driven by the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/telecommunications-act-1996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a> and growing concerns voiced by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/NIMBY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIMBY</a> critics, Larson Co.&rsquo;s camouflaged designs for network towers gained steady popularity.</p>
      <p>The arrival of 3G marked another stride forward, particularly in the network's utilization of data packets through incorporating "<strong>packet-switching</strong>." This advancement facilitated bandwidth-intensive tasks like <strong>downloading music and engaging in live video calls</strong>. The new generation boasted data transfer capabilities <strong>four times</strong> that of 2G, exceeding speeds of 2 Mb/s at that time.</p>
      <p>The emergence of much of the internet landscape we know today happened during 3G. Fundamental functions like music streaming, calls, text messaging, and online searches became <strong>integral to nearly all newly released phones</strong>. Concurrently, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apple-Inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple introduced the iPhone 1 and iPhone 2</a> toward the end of this era, marking the inception of a lineage of smartphones that would <strong>revolutionize communication</strong>.</p>
      <p>By the late 2000s, the 4th generation, known as LTE (Long-Term Evolution), entered the market, bringing with it <strong>speeds nearing 200 Mb/s</strong>. This new iteration demanded significant hardware adaptations, consequently driving sales for tech giants like <strong>Apple and Samsung</strong>.</p>
      <p>Then, in 2019, the initial iterations of <strong>5G were unveiled in South Korea</strong>, a milestone that would subsequently reverberate worldwide. As the gaming industry continued its expansion, telecommunications companies introduced "<strong>Gig-speed</strong>" internet, enabling nearly instantaneous connections.</p>
      <p>Today, the technology sector is poised to integrate <strong>IoT </strong>(Internet of Things) devices, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, and <strong>cloud computing</strong> to foster the growth of interconnected and intelligent societies. With a tentative <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/beyond-standards/how-6g-can-transform-the-world-and-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release projected around 2030</a>, 6G is set to usher in even faster internet speeds, allowing consumers to connect instantaneously, seamlessly integrate their homes with IoT, and thrive under the banner of sustainability.</p>
      <p>As society perpetually adapts to novel generations of the internet, we bid farewell to the "<strong>fauxliage</strong>" towers that once symbolized this evolution.</p>

        <figcaption class="bby"> By: Florence Liang</figcaption>
        <figcaption class="btext"> August is a special month for sky-gazers and fellow lunatics alike! This month will bookend itself with two remarkable lunar events. On the morning of August 1st, the world witnessed the Sturgeon Moon, a lunar phenomenon rich with cultural significance. Wrapping up the month, on August 30th, the much-celebrated blue moon will grace the night sky. These exceptional moons, commonly known as "supermoons," cast an enchanting spectacle, appearing noticeably larger than our usual lunar companion. </figcaption>
