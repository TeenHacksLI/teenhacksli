  <p> Imagine always forgetting your headphones and never being able to properly understand what an Instagram or TikTok video is saying. How would you understand the countless number of jokes on TikTok that rely on the user to listen to the song lyric or audio? This is the case for up to<b> 48 million Americans</b> who suffer from hearing loss or hearing impairments in one or both ears, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/15/social-media-accessibility-captions/">John Hopkins Medicine</a>. Many of those are daily users of both Instagram and TikTok. </p>
<p> To <b>increase awareness and accessibility</b> for users with hearing impairments, both TikTok and Instagram recently launched <b>auto-captions features</b>. Auto-captions are not new, however. Even <b>tech giants</b> such as Apple and Facebook have added features in an effort to make rising technology and their new products more accessible for all. In 2009, Apple launched <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/turn-on-and-practice-voiceover-iph3e2e415f/ios">VoiceOver</a>, a feature that gives audible descriptions of whatever appears on the user’s screen. In 2016, Facebook also incorporated automated <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/04/using-artificial-intelligence-to-help-blind-people-see-facebook/">alternative text</a> on photos that described the photo on the user’s feed to the user. Although these advancements take a stride in making social media accessible, there is still a long way to go. </p>
<p> While they did have the option for IGTV, Instagram now allows auto-captions for video stories and Reels. This is important considering almost <b>500 million people use Instagram Stories</b> everyday. To add the feature, a user must first use the app to record or upload a video. Then, they can press the stickers button, which opens up an array of stickers, including the new “Captions” sticker. After a few short moments waiting for the video to transcribe the audio, captions are automatically generated. With Instagram, the users can customize the caption and change their size and placement on the video. </p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22369507%2Ftiktok-automatic-captions-accessibility-feature-american-english-japanese&psig=AOvVaw1eKOjJ-_VzJaAc5_5B9_6X&ust=1621558948184000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCOjf1P2H1_ACFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD "> <img  class = "sideimg" src="blogimage/202167s.png" alt="picture of TikTok captions"> </a> 
<p> TikTok’s auto-captions feature is very similar to Instagram’s, however, there are a <b>few noticeable differences</b>. For one, Instagram’s captions are only currently available in English, but TikTok’s are available in <b>English and Japanese</b> (Way to one up Instagram, TikTok!). However, TikTok’s captions are not customizable, and users have the option to disable captions if they don’t want to see them on the videos on their feed. Furthermore, TikTok users can <b>edit their captions</b> in case the text turns out to be incorrect. Unfortunately, TikTok’s captions have not been used as widespreadly due to the number of other features it already has regarding captions. TikTok creators are mostly sticking with creating their own captions using the text feature, or are using the built-in text-to-speech feature in which a Siri-like voice reads out loud the text put onto a video. </p>
<p> TikTok has also worked with the organization the <a href="https://thedeafcollective.org/">Deaf Collective</a> to bring awareness towards people with hearing impairments. Even though tech companies and tools have a long way to go to make its products and apps accessible for everyone, it is considerable to see that <b>footsteps in the right direction</b> are being made.

               <figcaption class = "bby"> By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
              <figcaption class = "btext"> I know you all were waiting anxiously for the next LG phone to come out, but sadly, LG is dropping out of the smartphone business. That’s right— the most popular brand of smartphones ever confirmed on April 4th that they will no longer be creating or selling new LG phones.Just kidding, of course. If you forgot that LG even sold phones, don’t worry— we all did. Since 2015, the company has been suffering severe financial losses. In 2019, LG only made one third of the profits they were expecting to make.

               <figcaption class = "bby"> By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
              <figcaption class = "btext"> You’re a busy human with at least 2,375 different tasks to complete on your to-do list, and filling out food takeout online forms should not be one of them. That’s right, artificial intelligence powered assistants are at it again, finding more ways to make your life even easier.As a result of the pandemic, there was a surge in online takeout orders for restaurants. This past year, 89% of all takeout orders were placed online , and about 61% of those orders were from restaurants that previously only offered sit-down dining. Many restaurants and businesses were forced to enter the online world for the first time, and this trend is only increasing and evolving.
