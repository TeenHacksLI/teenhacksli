    <div class="column middle text" style="">
        <p>Since April of this year, <strong>India&rsquo;s population</strong> has <strong>skyrocketed</strong>, surpassing China's with a count of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/india-overtakes-china-to-become-worlds-most-populous-country" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.4 billion people</a>. As the population stabilizes, the need to innovate better services like education, food, and&mdash;<strong>especially&mdash;technology</strong> becomes paramount. In this rapidly-developing country&rsquo;s journey towards an advanced future, it's taking a step that many of its developed predecessors have made&mdash;<strong>exploring </strong><a href="https://teenhacksli.com/blog/blog2023815.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the Moon</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Through the <strong>Indian Space Research Organization</strong> (ISRO), India had already made contact with Earth&rsquo;s satellite once before on the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/chandrayaan-1/in-depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chandrayaan-1</a>. As such, they will continue to explore the lunar surface in their latest mission: the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_Details.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chandrayaan-3</a> (C-3).</p>
        <p>The C-3 is the <strong>third spacecraft</strong> under ISRO&rsquo;s development. It was proposed immediately <strong>following the Chandrayaan-2</strong> (C-2), which crash-landed on <strong>September 6, 2019</strong>, after a <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan2_science.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software glitch</a> interrupted communication between the lander and ground station. Since then, the ISRO has been implementing <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-3-plans-indicate-failures-in-chandrayaan-2/articleshow/72128771.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many design changes</a> to the Chandrayaan-3 with hopes to improve the outcome of the <strong>upcoming mission</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Both the C-2 and C-3 consist of a lander and a rover, named <strong>Vikram </strong>and <strong>Aditya </strong>in both vehicles, respectively. However, <strong>pinnacle malfunctions </strong>in the C-2&rsquo;s lander caused the mission to end in a <strong>crash landing</strong>.</p>
        <p>Whilst exiting its lunar orbital phase, the C-2&rsquo;s Vikram lander must <strong>slow down</strong> to be able to perform a soft landing. However, the lander <strong>veered away</strong> from the projected trajectory slightly earlier than expected, and upon entering its &ldquo;fine breaking phase,&rdquo; the Vikram was <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-went-wrong-with-chandrayaan-2-8827578/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 48 km/s (~30 mph) higher</a> than its <strong>ideal speed of 2 km/s</strong>. An unexpectedly high speed meant that the chances for a soft landing were growing unlikely.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the ISRO set a landing target of only 500 m2 (~1/10 of a square mile). Due to its early departure from its trajectory, Vikram needed to maneuver toward the intended landing site. This phase, in combination with earlier signals to hit the brakes, launched a <strong>bombardment of errors</strong> in the lander&rsquo;s software. Ultimately, a <strong>loss of communication</strong> between the ISRO and Chandrayaan-2 caused the lander to hit the lunar surface with a hard crash, spreading its mechanical remains over several kilometers across the Moon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The ISRO aims to make the Chandrayaan-3 triumph over the C-2 by ensuring its rover has a <strong>safe and soft landing</strong>. To achieve this, the ISRO has replaced the orbiter with a <strong>propulsion module</strong> and reduced the number of thrusters on the land from five to four. These changes&mdash;in combination with Vikram&rsquo;s new <strong>Laser Doppler Velocimeter</strong> (LDV)&mdash;help Vikram understand how it is oriented in three dimensions to prevent another orientation-related crash. Furthermore, the C-3 has additional solar energy cells, live-data transfer, faster polling rates, and increased rigidity in Vikram&rsquo;s frame and legs to ensure a <strong>successful landing</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With its new Chandrayaan-3, the ISRO hopes to show the world how India could <strong>continue discovering</strong> useful minerals on the Moon, following their discovery of ice during the Chandrayaan-1 mission. This desire will persist since the ISRO <a href="https://sdgs.jaxa.jp/en/article/detail/13.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anticipates a partnership</a> with Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and NASA to develop the Chandrayaan-4, which will <strong>borrow technology</strong> from the C-3 Vikram.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The ISRO anticipates the Chandrayaan-3 to land on August 23, 2023. Check out the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISRO&rsquo;s website for updates regarding C-3&rsquo;s status</a>!</p>

        <h2 class="btitle"> Once in a Blue Moon Event: Two Major Supermoons in August! </h2>
        <figcaption class="bby"> By: Florence Liang</figcaption>
        <figcaption class="btext"> August is a special month for sky-gazers and fellow lunatics alike! This month will bookend itself with two remarkable lunar events. On the morning of August 1st, the world witnessed the Sturgeon Moon, a lunar phenomenon rich with cultural significance. Wrapping up the month, on August 30th, the much-celebrated blue moon will grace the night sky. These exceptional moons, commonly known as "supermoons," cast an enchanting spectacle, appearing noticeably larger than our usual lunar companion. </figcaption>

        <h2 class="btitle"> From Essays to Artistry, Unveiling AI's Power and Ethical Quandaries </h2>
        <figcaption class="bby"> By: Florence Liang</figcaption>
        <figcaption class="btext"> Picture this: it's 3 am, a looming history project awaits, and the allure of OpenAI's latest ChatGPT release beckons. You're not alone in this struggle. As dawn approaches and your project remains unfinished, the siren call of AI-powered assistance grows stronger. More recently than ever, artificially intelligent learning models have morphed into creative tools for idea generation, scriptwriting, and artistry. From Elon Musk to Peter Thiel, OpenAI's ascent has captured the attention and financial backing of Silicon Valley giants, marking a significant milestone since its inception in 2015. These tech giants collectively pledged one billion dollars towards OpenAI’s research and development.
