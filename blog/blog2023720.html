  <p> You may remember <b>Capture the Flag</b> as “that tedious game” you played when you were younger. Some kids would enjoy playing as “attackers” by traveling to the enemy’s base to retrieve flags, while other children would play as “defenders” by protecting the team’s base. Yet, applied to <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a>, capture the flag (CTF) is an intense game <b>constantly outgrowing</b> the name it was given. </p>
<p> The win condition of CTFs in cybersecurity is largely the same as the goal of the childhood favorite: <b>retrieve as many flags as possible and win</b>. These flags are hidden throughout various cybersecurity challenges, challenging competitors in an array of unique subjects. However, many cybersecurity competitions are built with the intention to <b>encourage a new age</b> to explore the vast field of cybersecurity by teaching these concepts in a “gamified” fashion. </p>
<p> All CTF events will have prizes for competitors with the highest scores. Often, first, second, and third place are given awards, but honorable mentions are possible. <a href="https://picoctf.org/">PicoCTF</a>, a competition popular among middle- and high-school aged students, awards 1st place $3,000, 2nd place $2,000, and 3rd place $1,000 in addition to an invitation to Carnegie Mellon University (the CTF’s parent organization). </p>
<p> Beginner CTFs often introduce players to the <b>shell</b> (a program which allows users to interact with the computer) and other basic operating procedures used in cybersecurity. In more advanced CTFs, you will participate in events that challenge your skills in <a href="https://ctf101.org/">web exploitation, forensics, cryptography, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation.</a> </p>
<p> There are generally two common types of CTFs played throughout the world: Jeopardy and Attack-Defense. In <b>Jeopardy-style CTFs</b>, competitors aim to solve as many challenges as possible to stockpile as many points as possible. These challenges have hidden “flags” which competitors must find and exchange for points. On the other hand, <b>Attack-Defense CTFs</b> have a greater resemblance to “wargames,” where teams will defend their own machines and attempt to infiltrate opponents’ machines. </p>
<p> Depending on the type of Attack-Defense CTF planned, there is typically a red team —the attackers— and a blue team —the defenders. The <b>blue team</b> focuses on implementing measures to project a vulnerable piece of software. This could mean updating the software on the virtual machine or enabling a virus detection software, for example. There is an <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctfs">abundance of CTFs</a> where competitors play on the blue team while the judges will attempt to siege their machines on the red team. The <b>red team</b> attempts to take control over the computer by exploiting its vulnerabilities. Usually, this involves pinpointing the blue team’s oversights, exploiting bugs in old applications, and attempting to gain power as the system’s administrator. The field of cybersecurity may seem daunting at first, but rest assured because these <b>competitions are meant to help you learn! </b></p>
<p> With society advancing toward a greater online presence, it is crucial that <b>more people are aware</b> of ways they could be attacked and measures to defend themselves online. If you are ever interested in exploring cybersecurity, give a <a href="https://ccap.udel.edu/2022/08/23/ctf/">capture the flag</a> competition a try! </p>

      <h2 class="btitle"> Google’s New Takeout Trick </h2>
      <figcaption class = "bby"> By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
      <figcaption class = "btext"> You’re a busy human with at least 2,375 different tasks to complete on your to-do list, and filling out food takeout online forms should not be one of them. That’s right, artificial intelligence powered assistants are at it again, finding more ways to make your life even easier.As a result of the pandemic, there was a surge in online takeout orders for restaurants. This past year, 89% of all takeout orders were placed online , and about 61% of those orders were from restaurants that previously only offered sit-down dining. Many restaurants and businesses were forced to enter the online world for the first time, and this trend is only increasing and evolving. </figcaption>

      <h2 class="btitle"> Instagram & Tik Tok Adding Auto-Captions </h2>
      <figcaption class = "bby"> By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
      <figcaption class = "btext"> Imagine always forgetting your headphones and never being able to properly understand what an Instagram or TikTok video is saying. How would you understand the countless number of jokes on TikTok that rely on the user to listen to the song lyric or audio? This is the case for up to 48 million Americans who suffer from hearing loss or hearing impairments in one or both ears, according to John Hopkins Medicine. Many of those are daily users of both Instagram and TikTok. To increase awareness and accessibility for users with hearing impairments, both TikTok and Instagram recently launched auto-captions features. </figcaption>
