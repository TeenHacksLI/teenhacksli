  <p> Didn’t like the title of this blog post? Not a good poet but want to impress your valentine? Have trouble finishing that research paper worth 70% of your grade? Well fear not because there’s a new innovative piece of artificial intelligence that can <b> automatically write </b> unique pieces of text. </p>
  <p> The <b> Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 </b>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356180/openai-gpt-3-text-generation-words-day"> GPT-3 </a>, is a <b> language prediction model </b> created by <a href="https://openai.com/"> OpenAI </a>. Co-founded by Elon Musk, OpenAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) research and formation company. Released in the summer of 2020, the GPT-3 uses pre-trained algorithms to <b> generate more text </b> given a select amount of text. GTP-3 is the upgrade from its predecessor, GPT-2, which was released in 2019. While the GPT-2 uses 1.5 billion parameters in its neural network, GPT-3 uses an astonishing number of <b> 175 billion </b>. </p>
  <p> You can give the GPT-3 a text prompt such as a word or a phrase, and it will complete your text in <b> natural language </b>. From short stories to musical tabs, GPT-3 can finish your thoughts to an astounding level of accuracy. Ever get tired of coding? GPT-3 <b> can <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282692847481716737?lang=en"> even finish your HTML code </a>  </b> for you, as demonstrated by web programmer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharif-shameem/"> Sharif Shameem </a> who used GPT-3 to create web-page layouts. </p>
  <p> However, there are still some complications with GPT-3 technology that must be noted. For one, <b> harmful biases </b> can exist in AI models like GPT-3 which is a <b> sociotechnical system </b>. As a result, OpenAI has stated that they are committed to mitigating damaging biases and ensuring their models are filtered for safety and sensitivity. It is not perfect, and even CEO Sam Altman said, “The GPT-3 <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/"> hype is way too much</a>. It’s impressive but it still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes. AI is going to change the world, but GPT-3 is just a very early glimpse. We have a lot still to figure out.”</p>
   <a href="https://blog.crowdbotics.com/content/images/2020/07/GPT-3-2.jpg"> <img class = "sideimg" src="blogimage/2021412s.png" alt="Snow"> </a>
  <p> Nonetheless, that disclaimer did not stop other companies and startups from hopping onto the bandwagon. As of now, there are <b> more than 300 applications that employ GPT-3 technology </b>. These apps range from a  variety of different categories, including productivity and games. 
  For starters, <a href="https://fable-studio.com/"> Fable Studio </a> is a gaming application where users can create their own interactive stories through <b> virtual beings </b>. GPT-3 has allowed this app to “combine an artist’s vision, AI, and emotional intelligence to create powerful narratives,” as said by CEO Edward Saatchi. </p>
<p> Furthermore, <a href="https://askviable.com/"> Viable </a> is an application that summarizes customer feedback for companies to understand how to improve their programs. The GPT-3 employed in this application can identify themes in various different surveys from customers and can then <b> create a concise summary </b> for the user.
Additionally, <a href="https://headlime.com/"> Headlime </a> is an application that uses GPT-3 to <b> create catchy titles </b> given a piece of writing. The unique thing about it is that although it can generate multiple suitable titles, each title was not just a slight variation from the other; it was able to understand the different angles and perspectives that the piece of text was trying to convey. Overall, there is a lot in stock for GPT-3 and this is <b> just the beginning </b>. </p>

               <figcaption class = "bby"> By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
              <figcaption class = "btext"> Discord , your favorite gaming communication app may be on its way to be bought by tech giant Microsoft for a whopping price of $10 billion. Considering that four billion minutes of conversation happen on Discord each day and its current user base is over 150 million people, Discord has grown tremendously since its launch in 2015. So, why is Microsoft so keen on securing their bag on Discord? The number one reason is Microsoft’s longing for a consumer-facing community, other than Xbox. Its main competitors all have their own large community— Google has YouTube, Amazon has Twitch
